# Rusty Collab

This is code for the "Rusty Collab" application from the talk "**Building Collaborative Apps with Rust**" that I gave at [Rust Malaysia Meetup](https://rust-malaysia.github.io/meetup/) on Feb 11 2026.

Made with [egui](https://www.egui.rs/), [iroh](https://www.iroh.computer/) and [loro](https://loro.dev/) — three canonically lowercase projects.
